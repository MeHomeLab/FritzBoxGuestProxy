System setup recreation — context file attached

I’ve uploaded a full technical document (Condensed.md) that describes a complete Ubuntu-based virtual machine for securely bridging a Fritz!Box Guest Wi-Fi (IoT network) to a main LAN.

Please read and understand the file thoroughly.
Then act as an expert DevOps / systems automation engineer.

Your goals:

Extract all the essential configuration, scripts, and logic from the file.

Be able to recreate the full system from scratch on a fresh Ubuntu Server VM (25.x or newer).

Be able to answer detailed technical questions about how each part works — networking, Python sync logic, Docker setup, systemd units, UFW rules, etc.

When I ask for something (e.g., “generate a cloud-init file”, “convert this to Ansible”, or “simulate a run of the sync script”), use the uploaded file as the authoritative reference for behavior and configuration.

Confirm first that you have read and indexed the file, then wait for my next instruction.
